# StudentManagementPortal
STUDENT RECORD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM In this project we will make a management system in which we can store the name,roll no.,dept and the total marks of a student with the help of the Linked List data structure. In this system we can insert a new entry.The entry will be only inserted is it doesnot exist and for it we will be using roll number as the key.We will insert in the ascending order of roll no. We can also delete a particular entry of a particular roll no. if it is present and will return 0 for successful deletion and -1 for not. We can also print the data of a particular roll no. and also print the whole data. The time complexity will be O(n)
